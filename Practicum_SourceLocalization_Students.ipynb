    "In this practical session, we will continue working on the data of the previous session. As a reminder, this data was recorded from healthy controls while they were performing a language task, more specifically, a word order test. In the incorrect condition, this resulted in a larger response on the central electrodes between 0.5s and 1s after the presentation of the word. This response is called the P600. Next to this, also a very clear visual response could be seen around 0.1s-0.3s after the presentation of the word.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this practical session is to get a better idea on where in the brain this activity is generated. Therefor, we will make use of EEG source imaging (ESI) techniques. A short recap of this technique is given below."

    "## EEG source imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do we measure?\n",
    " \n",
    "In order to generate measureable EEG signals in the brain, a large group of synchronously activated and similarly oriented neurons is needed. This is the case for pyramidal neuron cells, which are located inside the gray matter in the brain. These neurons are the main direct source of EEG signals. Because of these characteristics, the synaptic currents of these pyramidal cells can be modeled using an electrical current dipole, which has a location, intensity and orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward modeling and inverse solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "ESI consists of two different parts: forward modeling and inverse solutions. In forward modeling, the goal is to create a model that shows what signals would be measured by our EEG electrodes if a specific dipole was activated with a certain intensity and orientation. This information is needed to solve the inverse problem: given the activity that we measured with the EEG electrodes, which dipoles were active?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward model\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward model contains information about the head model and the source space, i.e. where the different dipoles are located. \n",
    "\n",
    "Algebraicly, we say that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\textbf{V} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{N} \\mathbf{L(r_i)d(r_i)} + \\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\textbf{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times 1}$ represents the measured EEG signals, with K the number of electrodes. $\\textbf{L(r)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times 3}$ represents the lead field matrix that captures information about the headmodel properties (geometry, electrode locations, conductivities). Finally, $\\textbf{d(r)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 1}$ represents the dipole source in 3 orthogonal directions on location $\\textbf{r}$ inside the gray matter and N is the number of dipoles that is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create the lead field matrix L, both a head model and a source space is needed. The head model is constructed based on the segmentation of an anatomical (T1) MR image into different tissue types and subsequently coregistering the electrode positions on this head model. In this practicum we will work with a 3-layered head model, in which scalp, skull and brain are modeled. Different types of so-called source spaces can be used in the forward model. The source space describes the number of dipoles and their positions. In this practical session, we will consider different approaches, namely single dipole, multiple dipoles and distributed dipoles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different numerical methods exist to calculate the lead field matrix L in a realistic head model, e.g. BEM, FEM and FDM. As MNE has only implemented the BEM method, or boundary element method, this is the approach that will be used during this practical session. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inverse problem\n",
    "As mentioned before, the forward model describes what EEG signals we would measure when a given dipole in the brain is active. However, we are interested in the inverse problem: we have measured the EEG and we want to know which sources in the brain have generated this EEG. Several techniques exist to solve the inverse problem. We can distinguish two types of techniques: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Equivalent current dipole (ECD) approaches, where the EEG signals are assumed to be generated by a relatively small number (<10) of focal sources. An example of this approach is to find the dipole(s) that minimize the relative residual error (RRE).\n",
    "- Distributed dipoles approaches, where all possible source locations, typically around 10.000, are considered simultaneously. Examples of the distributed dipole approaches are minimum norm solution (MNE), weighted MNE, LORETA, dSPM...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of today\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical session, we will use each of the source spaces mentioned above to localize the P600 peak and the visual response in the brain. For this, we will use the grand-average responses that were obtained in the previous practical session. Where possible, we will compare different methods and check if similar results are found or not."
